              <p>
                Bliss Wellness is a holistic wellness brand offering intentionally crafted products and embodied
                wellness services. Our offerings are designed to support nervous system regulation, emotional grounding,

              <strong>What types of offerings does Bliss Wellness provide?</strong>
              <p>
                We currently offer guided breathwork, intention candles &amp; body care, intuitive guidance, and somatic
                alchemy sessions, both in private and group formats (as available). These experiences are designed to
                support embodiment, energetic regulation, trauma-informed release, and deeper mind–body awareness. All
                services are grounded in nervous-system safety, intuition, and conscious movement.
